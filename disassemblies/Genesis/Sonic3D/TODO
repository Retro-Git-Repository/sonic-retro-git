The disassembly is in IDA64 format (yes, IDA64 runs on Win32). Please don't
complain about "binary blobs". If you don't want it, then go and search for
a program that can do the same as IDA but with pure source code, and that
runs on Win32. Then I'll switch to pure source code. Some stuff will have to
be redone though (like adding the LevelHeader structure explicitly into the
source code).

The contents in the database are a bit outdated, so you may want to update
them or even give it a better formatting. Also all the data must be merged,
as well as adding it to the disassembly.

Also, all local variables must be renamed. My fault, they'll clash on
assemblers =[ Also, even if that's done, it won't work on ASMX because it
doesn't support "d*.b" pseudo-instructions.

Some labels you may want to check:

> IngameMode - Main subroutine for in-game code
> LoadLevel - Main subroutine for loading levels
> InitLevel - Initializes level-specific* stuff
> RunLevel - Level-specific* behaviour
> RunSonic - Sonic's behaviour code

*Boss code counts as level-specific.

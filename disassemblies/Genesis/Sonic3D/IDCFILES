There is a IDC file, named database. It's generated from the command "Dump
database to IDC file". Take a Sonic 3D ROM (the one used is included in the
SVN), make an IDA file from it and apply the IDC files. When you're done,
upload your changes by creating new IDC files.

There's another command called "Dump typeinfo to IDC file". The data
generated by this file is already generated by the command mentioned above,
so no need to generate both files.

That's it :)

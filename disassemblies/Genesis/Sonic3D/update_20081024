* Renamed the 'database' folder to 'old_database', I want to start a new
  clean one. Please help :) New database should be in... 'database' :P But
  before we start I'd like some suggestions on how to do it.

* Fixed as most local labels I could find to add an explicit @ in front of
  them so assemblers could catch them as real local labels (or at least
  ASM68K...).

* Labeled some of the monitor code.

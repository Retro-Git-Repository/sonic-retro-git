I started this disassembly on 15 September 2009 as a serious disassembly project, but eventually got sidetracked and disinterested, so I'm leaving my disassembly and notes here. Pretty much all of the code is disassembled; it just needs exploration. There are at least two new (that is, not Nemesis etc.) art compression formats, one of which, SSC (which I referred to as Compressed1 or C1 before I knew about drx's tools), was cracked and named by drx; his decompressor can be found at http://drx.pl/stuff/SSCDec.rar. IDA 5.5 needed for the idb. So yeah, good luck, and if you have any questions just contact me.

PS - Thanks to shobiz for telling me how to do negative (pc,d#.w) offset jumps.
